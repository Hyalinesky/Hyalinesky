## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Hyalinesky/Hyalinesky** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 😄 I am currently a second-year Master's student in **Software Engineering** at **Peking University**. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from **Wuhan University**.

- 🔭 My research interests include **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**. I enjoy identifying issues in models and improving them through post-training, reinforcement learning, and other methods. Recently, I have been focusing on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and VLMs while mitigating hallucination.

# 💻 Internships
- *2024.01 – 2024.05*, [NIO Shanghai](https://www.nio.cn/), China.  
  Contributed to the development of the LLM framework **BI Agent**, primarily responsible for intent understanding, task routing, and reasoning using LLMs.  

- *2025.04 – Present*, [Baidu](https://ir.baidu.com/company-overview), China.  
  Participated in pre-training of **search LLM** and post-training with reinforcement learning for **query rewriting LLM**. Primarily focused on *compressing LLM chains of thought* to reduce inference time for query rewriting LLM.
